	abstract = {Nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) is a highly conserved RNA turnover pathway that influences several biological processes. Specific features in messenger RNAs (mRNAs) have been found to trigger decay by NMD, leading to the assumption that NMD sensitivity is an intrinsic quality of a given transcript. Here, we provide evidence that, instead, an overriding factor dictating NMD sensitivity is the cell environment. Using several genome-wide techniques to detect NMD-target mRNAs, we find that hundreds of mRNAs are sensitized to NMD as human embryonic stem cells progress to form neural progenitor cells. Another class of mRNAs escape from NMD during this developmental progression. We show that the differential sensitivity to NMD extends to in vivo scenarios, and that the RNA-binding protein, HNRNPL, has a role in cell type-specific NMD. We also addressed another issue in the field—whether NMD factors are core or branch-specific in their action. Surprisingly, we found that UPF3B, an NMD factor critical for the nervous system, shares only 30\% of NMD-target transcripts with the core NMD factor UPF2. Together, our findings have implications for how NMD is defined and measured, how NMD acts in different biological contexts, and how different NMD branches influence human diseases.,

	abstract = {Nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) was originally coined to define a quality control mechanism that targets mRNAs with truncated open reading frames due to the presence of a premature termination codon. Meanwhile, it became clear that NMD has a much broader impact on gene expression and additional biological functions beyond quality control are continuously being discovered. We review here the current views regarding the molecular mechanisms of NMD, according to which NMD ensues on mRNAs that fail to terminate translation properly, and point out the gaps in our understanding. We further summarize the recent literature on an ever-rising spectrum of biological processes in which NMD appears to be involved, including homeostatic control of gene expression, development and differentiation, as well as viral defense.
